This is a project I put together in a day to practice PHP (I have not used it for a long time).
Will break valid PHP or Java  code into tokens and display with information and its index. It only supports valid PHP code not HTML/CSS mixed in
Try pasting a class or a source file of just plain PHP/Java. Try with smaller amounts of code because on my site if the string is too long the server rejects the input as too large.
