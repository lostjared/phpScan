Watch this video first it explains the project: https://youtu.be/lw5x-KC7a9E

This is a project I put together in a few days to practice PHP (I have not used it for a long time).
Will break valid C family like  code into tokens and display with information and its index. It only supports valid code.
Try pasting a small class or a source file of code. 

It is not 100% perfect but works with most code you can try it out here:
